char Array: An array of characters.

Note : strlen() == when we have char array[]

otherwise lenght() == when we have string directly.

String are terminated by null character i.e. '\0' and  (ASCII value of null character is 0).

In char array[], we can explicity take extra space for null character and it depends.
but in string class it is automatically there in the end of the string.

//to use string in-built functions include<string.h>
1)strlen() 2)strcmp 3)strcpy

int main(){

// 	char array[6] = {'m','a','y','a','n','k','\0'};
// 	cout << sizeof(array)/sizeof(array[0]);
    char ch[100];
    cout << "enter name" << endl;
    cin >> ch;
    cout << "your name is :" << endl;
    cout << ch;
}

Alternative ways of defining a string
char str[4] = "C++";
     
char str[] = {'C','+','+','\0'};

char str[4] = {'C','+','+','\0'};

Notice that, in the example only "Mayank" is displayed instead of "Mayank Kaushik".

This is because the extraction operator >> works as scanf() in C and considers a "space/tab/enter/new line character" has a terminating character.

In this program, a string str is declared. Then the string is asked from the user.

Instead of using cin>> or cin.get() function, you can get the entered line of text using getline().

cin.getline(arr,size) function takes the input stream then you can get "Mayank Kaushik" as ouput in cpp program.

cin.getline(fruits, 50); // for char array[]
getline(cin,name) // for string class and header file

#Array are passed by reference in functions,it means changes are reflected in actual place in memory.

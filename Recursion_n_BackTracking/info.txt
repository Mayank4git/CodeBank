What is Recursion?

When a function gives a call to itself is recursion.
(OR) A function that calls itself is known as a recursive function. And, this technique is known as recursion.

Working of Recursion in C++
void recurse()
{
    ... .. ...
    recurse();
    ... .. ...
}

int main()
{
    ... .. ...
    recurse();
    ... .. ...
}

Advantages of C++ Recursion

It makes our code shorter and cleaner.
Recursion is required in problems concerning data structures and advanced algorithms, such as Graph and Tree Traversal

Disadvantages of C++ Recursion

It takes a lot of stack space compared to an iterative program.
It uses more processor time.
It can be more difficult to debug compared to an equivalent iterative program.

Types of Recursion:

Head Recursion : when recursive call is before the processing part of the recursion block.
Tail Recursion : when recursive call is in the end of the block after base condition.

Important parts/components of recursion :
1) Base Case
2) Recursive Relation
3) Processing part
